# Postfix Expression Interpreter

This Java program is an interpreter for evaluating postfix expressions. It takes a postfix expression as input, processes it token by token, and computes the result using a stack-based approach. The program supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features:
- **Postfix Expression Evaluation**: The program evaluates postfix expressions by processing operands and operators from left to right using a stack.
- **Supports Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The program supports four arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- **Error Handling**: The program handles invalid expressions, such as insufficient operands or division by zero, and outputs appropriate error messages.

## How It Works:
1. **Input**: The user is prompted to enter a postfix expression with operands and operators separated by spaces.
2. **Tokenization**: The input is split into tokens (operands and operators).
3. **Stack Operations**: The program pushes operands onto the stack. When an operator is encountered, it pops two operands from the stack, performs the operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
4. **Result**: After processing the entire expression, the final result is printed on the stack.

## Example:
### Input:
### Output:
Rule 2: Operand(3) := 3 Stack: [3.0]
Rule 2: Operand(4) := 4 Stack: [3.0, 4.0]
Rule 1: Operator(+) := + Rule 3: Result(7.0) Operand(3.0) Operand(4.0) Operator(+) Stack: [7.0]
Rule 2: Operand(2) := 2 Stack: [7.0, 2.0]
Rule 1: Operator() := * Rule 3: Result(14.0) Operand(7.0) Operand(2.0) Operator() Stack: [14.0]
Rule 2: Operand(7) := 7 Stack: [14.0, 7.0]
Rule 1: Operator(/) := / Rule 3: Result(2.0) Operand(14.0) Operand(7.0) Operator(/) Stack: [2.0]

### Explanation:
1. The operands `3` and `4` are pushed onto the stack.
2. The `+` operator adds them, resulting in `7`.
3. The operand `2` is pushed onto the stack.
4. The `*` operator multiplies `7` by `2`, resulting in `14`.
5. The operand `7` is pushed onto the stack.
6. The `/` operator divides `14` by `7`, resulting in `2`.
